# Introduction 

Genome-wide assays provide powerful methods to profile the composition, the
conformation and the activity of the chromatin. Linear "coverage" tracks 
(generally stored as `.bigwig` files) are one of the outputs obtained 
when processing raw high-throughput sequencing data. These coverage tracks 
can be inspected in genome interactive browsers (e.g. `IGV`) to visually 
appreciate local or global variations in the coverage of specific genomic assays. 

The coverage signal aggregated over multiple genomic features can also be computed. 
This approach is very efficient to summarize and compare the coverage 
of chromatin modalities (e.g. protein binding profiles from ChIP-seq, transcription 
profiles from RNA-seq, chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq, ...) over 
hundreds and up to thousands of genomic features of interest. This unlocks a more 
quantitative description of the coverage over groups of genomic features. 

`tidyCoverage` implements the `CoverageExperiment` and the `AggregatedCoverage`
classes built on top of the `SummarizedExperiment` class. These classes 
formalize the extraction and aggregation of coverage tracks over 
sets of genomic features of interests. 

# Installation

`tidyCoverage` package can be installed from Bioconductor using the following
command: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("tidyCoverage")
```

# `CoverageExperiment` and `AggregatedCoverage` classes

## `CoverageExperiment`

`tidyCoverage` package defines the `CoverageExperiment`, directly extending
the `SummarizedExperiment` class. This means that all standard methods 
available for `SummarizedExperiment`s are available for `CoverageExperiment` 
objects.

```{r}
library(tidyCoverage)
showClass("CoverageExperiment")

data(ce)
ce

rowData(ce)

rowRanges(ce)

colData(ce)

assays(ce)

assay(ce, 'coverage')
```

Note that whereas traditional `SummarizedExperiment` objects 
store atomic values stored in individual cells of an assay, each cell of 
the `CoverageExperiment` `coverage` assay contains a list of length 1, 
itself containing an array. This array stores the per-base 
coverage score of a genomic track (from `colData`) over a set of genomic 
ranges of interest (from `rowData`). 

```{r}
assay(ce, 'coverage')

assay(ce, 'coverage')[1, 1] |> class()

assay(ce, 'coverage')[1, 1] |> length()

assay(ce, 'coverage')[1, 1][[1]] |> class()

assay(ce, 'coverage')[1, 1][[1]] |> dim()

# Compare this to `rowData(ce)$n` and `width(ce)`
rowData(ce)$n

width(ce)

assay(ce[1, 1], 'coverage')[[1]][1:10, 1:10]
```

## `AggregatedCoverage`

`AggregatedCoverage` also directly extends the `SummarizedExperiment` class. 

```{r}
showClass("AggregatedCoverage")

data(ac)
ac

rowData(ac)

rowRanges(ac)

colData(ac)

assays(ac)

assay(ac, 'mean')
```

It stores per-base coverage statistical metrics in assays (e.g. `mean`, `median`, ...). 
Each assay thus contains an **matrix of vectors**. 

```{r}
assay(ac[1, 1], 'mean')[[1]] |> dim()

assay(ac[1, 1], 'mean')[[1]] |> length()

assay(ac[1, 1], 'mean')[[1]][1:10]
```

# Manipulate `CoverageExperiment` objects

## Create a `CoverageExperiment` object

One can use `CoverageExperiment()` constructor along with: 

- A single `bigwig` file imported `as = "Rle"` and a `GRanges` or a *named* `GRangesList`; 
- A *named* list of `bigwig` files imported `as = "Rle"` and a `GRanges` or a *named* `GRangesList`; 
- A `BigWigFile` object and a `GRanges` or a *named* `GRangesList`; 
- A *named* `BigWigFileList` object and a `GRanges` or a *named* `GRangesList`; 

A numeric `width` argument also needs to be specified. It is used to center 
`features` to their midpoint and resize them to the chosen `width`. 

For example:

```{r}
library(rtracklayer)
bw_file <- system.file("extdata", "MNase.bw", package = "tidyCoverage")
bw_file

bed_file <- system.file("extdata", "TSSs.bed", package = "tidyCoverage")
bed_file

CE <- CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = import(bw_file, as = "Rle"), 
    features = import(bed_file),
    width = 3000
)
CE
```

And this works as well (note that in this case the names of the `GRangesList`
are being used as `rownames`):

```{r}
library(rtracklayer)
bw_file <- system.file("extdata", "MNase.bw", package = "tidyCoverage")
bw_file

bed_file <- system.file("extdata", "TSSs.bed", package = "tidyCoverage")
bed_file

CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = BigWigFile(bw_file), 
    features = GRangesList('TSSs' = import(bed_file)),
    width = 3000
)
```

## Bin a `CoverageExperiment` object 

By default, `CoverageExperiment` objects store _per-base_ track coverage. 
This implies that any cell from the `coverage` assay has as many columns 
as the `width` provided in the constructor function. 

```{r}
assay(CE, 'coverage')[1, 1][[1]] |> ncol()
```

If _per-base_ resolution is not needed, one can use the `window` argument in 
the constructor function to average the coverage score over non-overlapping bins. 

```{r}
CE2 <- CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = import(bw_file, as = "Rle"), 
    features = import(bed_file),
    width = 3000, 
    window = 20
)

CE2

assay(CE2, 'coverage')[1, 1][[1]] |> ncol()
```

If a `CoverageExperiment` object has already been computed, the `coarsen()` 
function can be used afterwards to reduce the resolution of the object. 

```{r}
CE3 <- coarsen(CE, window = 20)

CE3 

identical(CE2, CE3)
```

## Expand a `CoverageExperiment` object 

The `expand` method from the `tidyr` package is adapted to `CoverageExperiment`
objects to return a tidy `tibble`. This reformated object contains several 
columns: 

1. `track`: storing `colnames`, i.e. names of tracks used in the original `CoverageExperiment`; 
2. `features`: storing `rownames`, i.e. names of features used in the original `CoverageExperiment`; 
3. `chr`: features `seqnames` from the `CoverageExperiment`; 
4. `ranges`: features from the `CoverageExperiment` coerced as `character`; 
5. `strand`: features `strand` from the `CoverageExperiment`; 
6. `coord`: exact genomic position from the `CoverageExperiment`; 
7. `coverage`: coverage score extracted from corresponding `track` at `chr:coord`;
8. `coord.scaled`: 0-centered genomic position;

```{r}
expand(CE)
```

Note that if the `CoverageExperiment` object has been coarsened using `window = ...`,
the `coord` and `coord.scaled` are handled correspondingly. 

```{r}
expand(CE3)
```

## Plot coverage of a set of tracks over a single genomic locus

To illustrate how to visualize coverage tracks from a `CoverageExperiment` 
object over a single genomic locus of interest, 
let's use sample data provided in the `tidyCoverage` package. 

```{r}
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Import coverage tracks into a named list ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
tracks <- list(
    Scc1 = system.file("extdata", "Scc1.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"), 
    RNA_fwd = system.file("extdata", "RNA.fwd.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"),
    RNA_rev = system.file("extdata", "RNA.rev.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"),
    PolII = system.file("extdata", "PolII.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"), 
    MNase = system.file("extdata", "MNase.bw", package = "tidyCoverage")
) |> BigWigFileList()

locus <- GRanges("II:450001-475000")

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Instantiate a CoverageExperiment object ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
CE_chrII <- CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = tracks, 
    features = locus,
    width = width(locus)
)

CE_chrII
```

From there, it is easy to (optionally) `coarsen` then `expand` the 
`CoverageExperiment` into a `tibble` and use `ggplot2` for visualization. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
CE_chrII |> 
    coarsen(window = 10) |> 
    expand() |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = coord, y = coverage)) + 
        geom_col(aes(fill = track, col = track)) + 
        facet_grid(track~., scales = 'free') + 
        scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
        theme_bw() + 
        theme(legend.position = "none", aspect.ratio = 0.1)
```

In this plot, each facet represents the coverage of a different genomic track 
over a single region of interest (`chrII:450001-475000`). Each facet has 
independent scaling thanks to `facet_grid(..., scales = free)`.

# Manipulate `AggregatedCoverage` objects

## Aggregate a `CoverageExperiment` into an `AggregatedCoverage` object

It is often useful to `aggregate()` genomic `tracks` coverage over a set of 
genomic `features`. 

```{r}
AC <- aggregate(CE)

AC

assay(AC, 'mean')[1, 1][[1]] |> length()
```

```{r}
AC20 <- aggregate(CE, bin = 20)
AC20

assay(AC20, 'mean')[1, 1][[1]] |> length()
```

The resulting `AggregatedCoverage` objects can be readily coerced into a `tibble`. 

```{r}
as_tibble(AC20)
```

Note that the `coarsen-then-aggregate` or `aggregate-by-bin` are **NOT** 
equivalent. This is due to the certain operations being not commutative with `mean` (e.g. `sd`, `min`/`max`, ...). 

```{r}
# Coarsen `CoverageExperiment` with `window = ...` then per-bin `aggregate`:
CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = import(bw_file, as = "Rle"), features = import(bed_file),
    width = 3000
) |> 
    coarsen(window = 20) |> ## FIRST COARSEN...
    aggregate() |>          ## ... THEN AGGREGATE
    as_tibble()

# Per-base `CoverageExperiment` then `aggregate` with `bin = ...`: 
CoverageExperiment(
    tracks = import(bw_file, as = "Rle"), features = import(bed_file),
    width = 3000
) |> 
    aggregate(bin = 20) |>  ## DIRECTLY AGGREGATE BY BIN
    as_tibble()
```

## `AggregatedCoverage` over multiple tracks / feature sets

As en example for the rest of this vignette, we compute an `AggregatedCoverage` 
object using multiple genomic track files and multiple sets of genomic ranges. 

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(plyranges)

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Import genomic features into a named list ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
features <- list(
    TSSs = system.file("extdata", "TSSs.bed", package = "tidyCoverage"),
    `Convergent transcription` = system.file("extdata", "conv_transcription_loci.bed", package = "tidyCoverage")
) |> map(import) |> map(filter, strand == '+') 

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Import coverage tracks into a named list ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
tracks <- list(
    Scc1 = system.file("extdata", "Scc1.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"), 
    RNA_fwd = system.file("extdata", "RNA.fwd.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"),
    RNA_rev = system.file("extdata", "RNA.rev.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"),
    PolII = system.file("extdata", "PolII.bw", package = "tidyCoverage"), 
    MNase = system.file("extdata", "MNase.bw", package = "tidyCoverage")
) |> map(import, as = 'Rle')

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Compute aggregated coverage ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
CE <- CoverageExperiment(tracks, features, width = 5000, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
CE

AC <- aggregate(CE)
AC
```

## Plot aggregated coverages with `ggplot2`

Because `AggregatedCoverage` objects can be easily coerced into `tibble`s, 
the full range of `ggplot2` functionalities can be exploited to plot 
aggregated coverage signal of multiple tracks over multiple sets of genomic ranges. 

```{r}
AC |> 
    as_tibble() |> 
    ggplot() + 
    geom_aggrcoverage()
```

Oopsie, a little busy here. Let's color by tracks and split facets by `features`:

```{r}
AC |> 
    as_tibble() |> 
    ggplot(aes(col = track)) + 
    geom_aggrcoverage() + 
    facet_grid(features ~ .)
```

Nearly there, few cosmetic changes and we are done! 

```{r}
AC |> 
    as_tibble() |> 
    ggplot(aes(col = track, linetype = track %in% c('RNA_fwd', 'RNA_rev'))) + 
    geom_aggrcoverage() + 
    facet_grid(features ~ .) + 
    labs(x = 'Distance from genomic feature', y = 'Mean coverage (± 95% conf. intervale)') + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

# Use a tidy grammar

`tidySummarizedExperiment` package implements native `tidyverse` functionalities 
to `SummarizedExperiment` objects and their extensions. It tweaks the way 
`CoverageExperiment` and `AggregatedCoverage` objects look and feel, but 
do not change the underlying data or object. 

In particular, this means that data wrangling _verbs_ provided by `dplyr` 
can directly work on `CoverageExperiment` and `AggregatedCoverage` objects, 
provided that the `tidySummarizedExperiment` package is loaded. 

```{r}
library(tidySummarizedExperiment)
CE

AC <- CE |> 
    filter(track == 'Scc1') |> 
    filter(features == 'Convergent transcription') |> 
    aggregate()

AC
```

This also means that `as_tibble()` coercing step is facultative 
if the `tidySummarizedExperiment` package id loaded. 

```{r}
AC |> 
    ggplot() + 
    geom_aggrcoverage() + 
    labs(x = 'Distance from locus of convergent transcription', y = 'Scc1 coverage') + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

**Note:** To read more about the `tidySummarizedExperiment` package and the overall 
`tidyomics` project, read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.10.557072v2). 

## Example workflow using tidy grammar

```{r}
CoverageExperiment(tracks, features, width = 5000, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE) |> 
    filter(track == 'RNA_fwd') |> 
    aggregate(bin = 20) |> 
    ggplot(col = features) + 
    geom_aggrcoverage(aes(col = features)) + 
    labs(x = 'Distance to center of genomic features', y = 'Forward RNA-seq coverage') + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

# Example use case: `AnnotationHub` and `TxDb` resources

## Recover TSSs of forward human genes 

Let's first fetch features of interest from the human `TxDb` resources. 

```{r}
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene::TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
TSSs <- GenomicFeatures::genes(txdb) |> 
    filter(strand == '+') |> 
    anchor_5p() |> 
    mutate(width = 1)
```

These 1bp-wide `GRanges` correspond to forward TSSs genomic positions. 

## Recover H3K4me3 coverage track from ENCODE

Let's also fetch a real-life ChIP-seq dataset (e.g. `H3K4me3`) 
from ENCODE stored in the `AnnotationHub`:

```{r}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ah['AH34904']
H3K4me3_bw <- ah[['AH34904']]

H3K4me3_bw
```

## Compute the aggregated coverage of H3K4me3 ± 3kb around the TSSs of forward human genes 

We can now extract the coverage of `H3K4me3` over all the human forward TSSs 
(± 3kb) and aggregate this coverage. 

```{r}
CoverageExperiment(
    H3K4me3_bw, TSSs, 
    width = 6000, 
    scale = TRUE, center = TRUE
) |> 
    aggregate() |> 
    ggplot() + 
    geom_aggrcoverage(aes(col = track)) + 
    facet_grid(track ~ .) + 
    labs(x = 'Distance from TSSs', y = 'Mean coverage') + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

We obtain the typical profile of enrichment of `H3K4me3` over the +1 nucleosome. 

## With more genomic tracks

This more complex example fetches a collection of 15 different ChIP-seq genomic 
tracks to check their profile of enrichment over human forward TSSs. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# ~~~~~~~~~~ Recover 15 different histone PTM ChIP-seq tracks ~~~~~~~~~~ #
ids <- c(
    'AH35163', 'AH35165', 'AH35167', 'AH35170', 'AH35173', 'AH35176', 
    'AH35178', 'AH35180', 'AH35182', 'AH35185', 'AH35187', 'AH35189', 
    'AH35191', 'AH35193', 'AH35196'
)
names(ids) <- mcols(ah[ids])$title |> 
    gsub(".*IMR90.", "", x = _) |> 
    gsub("\\..*", "", x = _)
bws <- map(ids, ~ ah[[.x]]) |> 
    map(resource) |> 
    BigWigFileList()
names(bws) <- names(ids)

# ~~~~~~~~~~ Computing coverage over TSSs ~~~~~~~~~~ #
AC <- CoverageExperiment(
    bws, TSSs, 
    width = 4000, 
    scale = TRUE, center = TRUE
) |> aggregate()

# ~~~~~~~~~~ Plot the resulting AggregatedCoverage object ~~~~~~~~~~ #
AC |> 
    as_tibble() |> 
    mutate(
        histone = dplyr::case_when(
            stringr::str_detect(track, 'H2A') ~ "H2A", 
            stringr::str_detect(track, 'H2B') ~ "H2B", 
            stringr::str_detect(track, 'H3') ~ "H3"
        )
    ) |> 
    ggplot() + 
    geom_aggrcoverage(aes(col = track)) + 
    facet_grid(~histone) + 
    labs(x = 'Distance from TSSs', y = 'Mean histone PTM coverage') + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'top') + 
    hues::scale_colour_iwanthue() + 
    hues::scale_fill_iwanthue() 
```
