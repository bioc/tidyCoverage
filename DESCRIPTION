Description: `tidyCoverage` framework enables tidy manipulation 
    of collections of genomic tracks and features using 
    `tidySummarizedExperiment` methods. It facilitates the 
    extraction, aggregation and visualization of genomic coverage over 
    individual or thousands of genomic loci, relying on `CoverageExperiment`
    and `AggregatedCoverage` classes. This accelerates the integration 
    of genomic track data in genomic analysis workflows.
